		<description><![CDATA[Gwen, it’s difficult to comment on what could be wrong by just looking at the screenshot. In last one week, more than 100 users have downloaded JConverter and we haven’t received any such issue so far.

Current version is a beta version and there would be issues so we are relying on help from our users to find them so we can fix the issues. If you could provide more details about the issue then it would help. You can get in touch with us via email using this form – http://www.sopantech.com/contact-us.html]]></description>
